## What's Tableland?

Tableland is a decentralized network for relational, composable data. It's SQL storage but decentralized. The data in Tableland can be written or read using SQL queries, but here a smart-control holds Access Control Logic, which gives access to manipulate the data to addresses. Checkout [Tableland docs](https://docs.tableland.xyz/) to learn more.
